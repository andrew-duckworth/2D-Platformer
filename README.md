Check In:
-we're feeling excited for this, a bit nervous to tackle the tech

Wellbeing:
-breaks (knowing you can take those when you think you need them)
-being open and honest with each other, any time your feeling stressed, etc.
-giving eachother space when we need it.
-taking the small wins as a chance for a break, so we can actually celebrate and savour these.
-having huddles (seperate from standups) to check in on eachother aswell as shoulder taps if we think anyone is struggling.
-be flexible, we all know the plan will change and doingretros daily will let us adapt to thr challanges we face daily

Expectation setting and agreements:
-we're going to work 9-5, if you want to work outside this time keep it to your own part of the project and communicate with the team what you're doing.
-communication will mostly be group discussions as we are a small enough group for that, but we can opt out if we dont think we need to be there and have a tldr in the slack.
-we'll do work on sunday but only if we havent hit mvp by end of friday.

Getting help:
-formulate our questions before asking them.
-15minutes of self struggle, 15 minutes of group struggle, then ask facilitators for help.
-non technically, asking Patch or Joseph to sit in on a huddle or do a check in with them to make a plan to sort whatever issue has arisen.

How do you make sure everyone feels included:
-standups dont end until everyone knows what theyre doing and have had a chance to speak.
-using huddles to check up on eachother.
-making group decisions and inviting everyone to those.

Roles and agile:
-we have assigned the 4 main roles plus a teamlead to crack the whip if we start slacking or get off track.
-retros at the end ofeach day to reflect how our work went

Survival:
-inviting everyone to lunch, but still leaving it open for the to decline.
-team building outside of dev in the form of games.
-entertainment (drinks, etc)
