### Initial thoughts:
As a team we just really keen to get stuck into it once the research is done. We are going to be researching at a relatively simular pace to try and speed up the process. Evveryone is just excited to get amongst it a churn out an awesome product, We all have our own research targets and will update the rest of group as tech comes into play. 


## End of Day reflections:

### Pros

- Good communications within the group, especially when coming to explaining new tech
- Great progress towards MVP
- Vibes were great
- Git flow went well

### Cons

- Small tech issues due to lack of knowledge with the tech
